### üìÅ Model Files

The following pretrained DeepIP models are provided for different species:

| File Name               | Description                                                  |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `human.train.model.hdf5` | DeepIP model trained on human polyA sites (genome: **hg38**)   |
| `mouse.train.model.hdf5` | DeepIP model trained on mouse polyA sites (genome: **mm10**)   |
| `ath.train.model.hdf5`   | DeepIP model trained on *Arabidopsis thaliana* (genome: **TAIR10**) |

These models can be directly used to remove internal priming artifacts in polyA site prediction tasks for their respective species.
